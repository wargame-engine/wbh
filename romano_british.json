Despite the fact that these units were rarely deployed in 'the west', many of them had very obviously Gaulish names.

According to records and lore, the Saxons were employed by mercenaries to drive away the Picts. Archaeological evidence shows that while half of the Romano-British lands were quick to fall, the rest of the area stayed quite wealthy and urbanized for awhile. Archaeological evidence also shows strong indication of trade with the Byzantines, constant feasting sites along the coast, and plentiful trade of rare tin and valuable wool. Considering that much of 'mainland europe' was being pillaged and was in worse condiiton, the Romano-British would be along the wealthiest and most able to employ 'savages' and 'barbarians' as mercenaries. The romans indeed, had maintained the practice of 'Foederati'",
