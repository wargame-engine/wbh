Many of these mounted warriors were actually barbarians recruited from nomadic warrior peoples, and various other cultures with strong traditions of mounted warriors. The best of these warriors saw heavy action in 'the east', and were known as 'Equites cataphractarii'. Despite the fact that these units were rarely deployed in 'the west', many of them had very obviously Gaulish names. It wouldn't be especially  hard for retired Equites cataphractarii, romanized peoples, and various mounted cultures in the west to form their own brand new 'Equites cataphractarii'. Unlike what some people mistakenly believe, the Auxilia 'Sarmatians', were last recorded in the area around the 300s and over time any cavalry traditions they taught would be forgotten.",
