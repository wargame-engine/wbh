The freemen were given months to organize themselves, get their equipment, and train for the coming campaign. There were harsh punishments for not answering the call, but the costs of equipment and the months not spent managing the farm or estates could be very expensive. This system was in place till the first crusade, being in place for both the Franks and Holy Roman Empire. ",
