Those obligated to answer the call were the freemen and various higher classes, but the term usually refers to large groups of freemen assembled for a military campaign. The freemen were given months to organize themselves, get their equipment, and train for the coming campaign. There were harsh punishments for not answering the call, but the costs of equipment and the months not spent managing the farm or estates could be very expensive. This system was in place till the first crusade, being in place for both the Franks and Holy Roman Empire. ",

The normans were the 'spearpoint', pun intended of this new evolution, as their calvary turned away from the throwing spear and sword, and towards the lance and stabbing spear. Despite these slow and study changes, for many decades the average 'knight' or 'milites' was a veteran mercenary or soldier, who had accumulated wealth and experience over time.",
